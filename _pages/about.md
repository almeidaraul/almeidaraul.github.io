Computer Scientist (bachelor's degree from UFPR, 2022; MSc from UFPR, 2025). Currently working as a Software Engineer at Canonical, specifically in Cloud QA.

Until very recently I was an active member of the CAPIMARA competitive programming group in UFPR.

My interests are algorithms, data analysis and system design.
