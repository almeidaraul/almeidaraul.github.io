Glikoz is a glucose and insulin use data analysis tool to assist
the treatment of diabetes. Currently it is built around information
exported from the Diaguard app as backup CSVs. It was created with
endocrinology professionals in mind, as many proprietary, often inaccessible
tools have very insightful tools such as this, but open-source applications
such as Diaguard do not. This makes a very important difference in how
a medical doctor can help diabetes treatment in a patient.

If you like programming, Glikoz can be very interesting too. It envolves
very diverse problems, such as ifnromation parsing, data analysis and report
creation. It is also very expansible, so it is possible to aggregate subprojects
such as AI-assisted analysis and a platform for accessing and sharing reports. If
you would like to contribute, let me know!

You can find more information in [the Glikoz GitHub page](https://github.com/almeidaraul/glikoz/).
