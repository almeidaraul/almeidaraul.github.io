Agenda is a tool for scheduling command-line
programs with too many arguments.  It allows
the user to configure many runs at once in a
configuration file and run a single, simple
command that will take care of the rest. This
makes running tests, experiments and
per-batch scripts a lot easier.

It started as a tool for me to manage all the
deep learning experiments I had to run in
my master's research. It is somewhere in the
middle between running each script manually
and using a complex large-scale scheduling
program.
