This is a joke project to map each LoL character with
one of the four Blackpink members with a deep
neural network.

The neural network is trained on recognizing blackpink
members. An important part of the project consists of
scraping an image search platform for photographs of
each member and then processing this data (resize, face
crop).

You can [check it out on GitHub](https://github.com/almeidaraul/kindalisa/).
