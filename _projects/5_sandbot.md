This is a Telegram bot that calculates your recommended wake-up time from
the time you expect to fall asleep or vice-versa. It is based on the
[90-minute standard REM cycle definition](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/stages-of-sleep/rem-sleep),
which essentially states your sleep can be divided into 90-minute cycles
and healthy, energizing sleep consists of uninterrupted cycles (i.e.,
you wake up at the end of a cycle, not in the middle of it).

The name Sandbot comes from the Sandman myth, a being who can control someone's
sleep and their dreams. The picture I use is from the comic book of the same name
written by Neil Gaiman.
