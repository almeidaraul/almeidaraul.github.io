This is a Telegram bot that computes whether a user is expected to be
eligible to take part in the ICPC in the current year, and gives
information on eligibility rules and exceptions. It was built with a
focus on people who are new to Competitive Programming, as these rules
can often be confusing and even conflicting depending on translation
details.
